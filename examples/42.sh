# Group a list of commands with braces: { list }

{
    echo "hi"
    sleep 3
    echo "bye"
}

# there is nothing special about braces.
# it's just a way to group commands together
# for example in an if statement.

# Note: Make sure you add ';' or newline to the end of commands
# Note: Add space before and after braces.
