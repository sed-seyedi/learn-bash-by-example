#!/bin/bash

# set a new variable
X=3
# use $ when you want the value
echo $X


# Note: there is no space before and after =
# Let's image we write it like this:
# X =3
# Then bash thinks we want the pass the argument =3 to the command X
# Or, what if we write it like this:
# X = 3
# Then bash thinks we want to pass two arguments (= and 3) to the command X
